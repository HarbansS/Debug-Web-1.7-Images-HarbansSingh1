# **The src Attribute**
## The required src attribute specifies the path (URL) to the image.

_Note:_ When a web page loads, it is the browser, at that moment, that gets the image from a web server and inserts it into the page. Therefore, make sure that the image actually stays in the same spot in relation to the web page, otherwise your visitors will get a broken link icon. The broken link icon and the alt text are shown if the browser cannot find the image.

# **Example**
```<img src="img_chania.jpg" alt="Flowers in Chania">```

# **The alt Attribute**
The required alt attribute provides an alternate text for an image, if the user for some reason cannot view it (because of slow connection, an error in the src attribute, or if the user uses a screen reader).

The value of the alt attribute should describe the image:

# **Example**
```<img src="img_chania.jpg" alt="Flowers in Chania">```
If a browser cannot find an image, it will display the value of the alt attribute
