## Image Size - Width and Height
You can use the style attribute to specify the width and height of an image.

# Example
```<img src="img_girl.jpg" alt="Girl in a jacket" style="width:500px;height:600px;">```

### Alternatively, you can use the width and height attributes:
```<img src="img_girl.jpg" alt="Girl in a jacket" width="500" height="600">```
  
The width and height attributes always define the width and height of the image in pixels.
The width and height attributes always define the width and height of the image in pixels.

**Note:** Always specify the width and height of an image. If width and height are not specified, the web page might flicker while the image loads.

# Images in Another Folder
If you have your images in a sub-folder, you must include the folder name in the src attribute:

_Example_
```<img src="/images/html5.gif" alt="HTML5 Icon" style="width:128px;height:128px;"> ```

# Images on Another Server/Website
Some web sites point to an image on another server.

To point to an image on another server, you must specify an absolute (full) URL in the src attribute:

_Example_
```<img src="https://www.w3schools.com/images/w3schools_green.jpg" alt="W3Schools.com">```

**Notes on external images:** External images might be under copyright. If you do not get permission to use it, you may be in violation of copyright laws. In addition, you cannot control external images; they can suddenly be removed or changed.
