"HTML Images Syntax
The HTML ```<img>``` tag is used to embed an image in a web page.

Images are not technically inserted into a web page; images are linked to web pages. The ```<img>``` tag creates a holding space for the referenced image.

The ```<img>``` tag is empty, it contains attributes only, and does not have a closing tag.

The ```<img>``` tag has two required attributes:

src - Specifies the path to the image
alt - Specifies an alternate text for the image" *w3schools*
**Syntax**
```<img src="url" alt="alternatetext">```
